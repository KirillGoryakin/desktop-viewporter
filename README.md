An extension for IOS Safari browser, which allows you to change your viewport width to 1440px. This can help you to get an actual desktop version of a web page, when Safari's native "Request Desktop website" just changes your request headers.

After activation the extension in Settings, go to your webpage, click **aA** and click on **Desktop Viewporter** to toggle your viewport width.

## Install
